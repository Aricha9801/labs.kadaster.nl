  skos:definition "Type describing the abstract superclass of most CityGML features.  Its purpose is to provide a creation and a termination date as well as a reference to corresponding objects in other information systems.  A generalization relation may be used to relate features, which represent the same real-world object in different Levels-of-Detail, i.e. a feature and its generalized counterpart(s).  The direction of this relation is from the feature to the corresponding generalized feature."@en.

As subclass of _CityObject, a _Site inherits all attributes and relations, in particular an id, names, external references, and generalization relations."@en.
